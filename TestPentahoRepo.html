<!--
  TestPentahoRepo.html is a test driver to verify that PentahoRepo.js actually works as designed.  
  To use, open the in a browser with Pentaho running.  The test driver assumes you have Pentaho 
  available on localhost:8080/pentaho.  It also assumes you have the SteelWheels examples installed
  and admin / password is a valid login.  If any of these assumptions are not correct, then modify 
    the variables to match your environment.
